# Multicore Rom Helper
A tool for Datafrog Sf2000 built on top of  <a href="https://github.com/SpardaHunter/ZFBimagesToolSparda/releases/tag/ZFBimagesToolSparda">zfbimagetool</a> with some changes and added features. It helps you create and then copy ZFB files (in bulk) for the multicore roms to the stock rom director and rebuild the Roms automatically.
